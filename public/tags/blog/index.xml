      <description>We moved. Oh, you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice? Good! That&amp;rsquo;s how it should work.&#xA;Cloudflare now serves the site content from your closest available source.&#xA;What this means? Faster load times, creating a better user experience.&#xA;There are some other improvements as well. The site is statically generated, this means improved SEO, less vulnerable to compromise, no infrastructure costs.</description>

      <description>Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re open to the public so I guess I might as well introduce myself. Joshua Marcum here, and until very recently I was a Security Engineer for a global network communications provider&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity incident response team. I&amp;rsquo;ve always held an interest in trying to understand server technology, this obsession started at age ten when I created my first website. This decision started a chain reaction. I decided free hosting was not good enough, I needed a domain, and then now some place to host my site.</description>

Normally, I enjoy nothing more than seeing an entire stack provisioned by a compose file. Sadly, a single compose file isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for a development server with multiple domains and frequently changing applications. When you&amp;rsquo;re application is production ready, I recommend switching to a Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel to eliminate any unnecessary port exposure.</description>
