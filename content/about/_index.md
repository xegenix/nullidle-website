# Welcome

The intended use of this page is to describe the purpose of this blog, well you found yourself on a engineering blog covering web and server-related technology. At the moment I am unemployed, thanks to a 1,200 person layoff right before Thanksgiving. Thanks Lumen Technologies! Yep... definitely smart laying-off people that protect your organization for inside and outside threats. Ex-Lumen CIRT (Cybersecurity Incident Response Team) member. 

The situation is looking up though, I received a job description from a recruiter today and signed the right to represent. I'm staying hopeful things work out.

If you know any projects which might benefit from an experienced engineer in Security, Systems, Cloud, or DevOps roles... Please, send me a message!
