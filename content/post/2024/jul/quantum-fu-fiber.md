# The Quantum FU Fiber	
I know one thing and one thing only, if life has a sexual preference... it's definitely me. You may think I am joking when I say that but anyone that gets to know me eventually admits... it really does have it out for me. So basically... long story short. I got fiber internet and it blows. Not because of the service itself, there is much more to this story. Since childhood I've dreamed of the day I could get a connection with the same uplink speed as down, since like 10 years old. I’ve waited damn near 28 years to run a viable server out of my own home. No longer would I need a dedicated server, I could eliminate countless paid VPS instances, it'd save me a metric shit-ton of cash.

When I saw tuat our neighborhood was being installed with Quantum Fiber, I checked that shit religiously until it showed available for sign-up at my address. Seriously, I checked the website like 5 or more times a day since it had been installed in our neighborhood. 

Our previous internet provider had good speeds down but their uplink completely blew, when we got nailed with a bunch of overages we just ended it which everyone in our house was then out of internet. My family and another family decided to work the system and go in on a leasing a large home splitting the rent costs. It was supposed to help both families save and still live nicely, anyhow back to the story. I have no damn clue why but they setup an appointment even though I already had one set for installation of 8GB service. Not sure how the hell this happened but they managed to get an earlier installation date than I could! Whatever, I figure we'd just have seperate lines. So install date comes for them and later in the day I get a text my appointment was canceled. I called Quantum Fiber like wtf (not really), only to be informed I was shit-out-of-luck (pretty typical), and they selected the cheapest plan! If 2GB from Cox wasn't sufficient, no way in hell 500mb is going to work. I really want to know what the hell I did to deserve such continiously shit luck. 

So thank you Quantum FU Fiber for letting my asshole room mates high-jack my service installation with the cheapest f#&king plan you have. Why the hell would you not just say you’re already scheduled for install on the 18th! Seriously fml.
