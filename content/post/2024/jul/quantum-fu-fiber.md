# The Quantum FU Fiber	
I know one thing and one thing only, if life has a preference of who it likes to screw, it's definitely me. You may think I am joking when I say that but anyone that gets to know me eventually admits... it really does have it out for me. So basically... I’ve been dreaming of the day I could get a connection with the same uplink speed as down since I was 10 years old. I’ve waited damn near 28 years. Our neighborhood was recently installed with Quantum Fiber, I’ve been religiously checking the site for availability to my home multiple times a day since the fiber was installed until I got my appointment. 

We recently departed from Cox, they really suck. So the whole house was out of internet and we have room mates. I have no damn clue why but they setup an appointment after I already had one set to get the 8GB service installed, but the assholes managed to get an earlier installation date then I did as well. (There goes life really liking me again for some odd reason). Whatever, the families will have seperate lines. So install date comes for them and later in the day I get a text my appointment was canceled. I called Quantum Fiber only to be informed I was shit-out-of-luck (as always), and I've been screwed into using the cheapest plan they have! Seriously life, what did I ever do to deserve such an endless stream of bullshit bad luck!? 

So thank you Quantum FU Fiber for letting my asshole room mates highjack my service installation instead of saying you’re already scheduled for install like your f#*King supposed too.

FML!
