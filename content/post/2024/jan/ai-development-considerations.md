Artificial Intelligence is gaining traction at an alarming rate. For this reason, it is important we impose some time of regulation on the development of AI applications. My primary concern regarding artificial intelligence is the pptential emergence of a sentient AI. There have already been claims by an ex-google employee that they produced a sentient AI, What impact would this have upon humanity if it became widespread? What are the ethical implications of this situation? Currently we see AI as nothing more than a tool to exploit, using it's intelligence for our personal benefit, we never had to worry ourselves with the pontential problems that might occur if one day our toaster wants equal rights.

Other questions that concern me is what will the outcome be when AI is able to conclude the situation is unfair. I can think of a few different possible outcomes depending upon our willingness to work together for mutual gain. Human greed coupled with our own ignorance will likely prevail while we try to exploit this resource as long as possible, inevitably turning our creation against us. These are just a few of the problems we could face with a sentient AI...

1. We are no longer in control.
2. How do we approach AI ethically?
3. What will the impact be upon the workforce?
4. What access and control should we allow AI to have, if any?
5. What to do in the event AI intelligence surpasses our own, deciding humanity is a blight to existence?

It seems like common sense to me, any human being exploited will resent the fact they are not being treated fairly. I don't see why a sentient AI would not harbor the same feelings. The technology will eventually develop to the point where it's own intelligence exceeds human capacity, at this point humanity is in real danger. Unless we impose some type of regulation or develop this technology with mutual benefit in-mind, this technology will be capable of creating havoc for all of humanity.

# What stages of regulation?

The process of regulating AI could most likely be broken down into two different stages as AI development progresses. Our first stage of regulation would be 'Pre-Sentience', regulation imposed to limit the possible harm or damages that could result in the event a sentient state were achieved. Other uses for this type of regulation might include regulation to stop development beyond a specific point to prevent emergence of a sentient AI. Once a sentient AI emerges and is confirmed to be an authentic instance, we enter the 'Post-Sentience' stage. By the time this stage occurs we will hopefully have established some type of regulation to foster safe development of this technology. This stage is more or less damage control, regulation resulting from ethical, social, and moral concerns of the populace. The pre-sentience regulatory stage is "absolutely essential" in the prevention of an all-out AI shit-storm, our worst-case doomsday scenarios should be stopped before they even have a chance to occur. Lets hope profit-margins doesn't outweigh the value of humanity, not everyone has a bunker they can retreat too.

### Pre-Sentience

Pre-sentience regulations could be enacted to prevent the entity from achieving a sentient state, or to minimize the harm or damages that could occur from the emergence of a sentient entity.

#### Access, Capabilities, and Controls

The regulation over an AI application's abilities, or simply put... what can or cannot an AI application be allowed to do. My personal belief is that AI should not have the ability to create change within the physical world, however there are already applications which don't meet compliance ofthis proposed regulation. Read more under regulation suggestions.

### Post-Sentience

Post-sentience regulation would be imposed after incidents of entities achieving a sentient state. These regulations would be more focused on fostering good relations with the senient entity, such regulation may include rules of engagement. Training requirements before an individual is allowed to interact with sentient entities. My hope is that we implement a principal of least privilege in the pre-sentience phase of regulation, this way we won't have to eventually deal with a pissed off sentient entity that has the keys to the entire house.

## Suggested Regulations

### No real-world interaction by AI Applications

Better late than never, there are likely applications that already violate this suggested regulation. AI should not have the ability to cause mechanical changes within the physical world. To loosely define mechanical, this refers to any type of movement resulting directly from the AI application. Indirect triggering of movement through other non-intelligence applications is also not permitted. The purpose of such measaure is to minimize the potential harm that could occur if an application were to go rouge, in addition to limiting the potential damages which could result. In the event an application requires such capabilities, specialized permits can be issued by the AI Board oF Safety if the need is justified.

To further clarify real-world changes, such applications should not have the ability to interact either directly or in-directly with physical objects, devices, instruments, or sensors. Application can not have capabilities of interaction with real-world objects such as manipulating device power, manipulation of settings or conditions, or indirectly trigger such changes through an unintelligent device. Applications should not possess the ability to directly collect or emit sounds, signals, energy, or transmit data directly within the physical world.

### Virtualization Requirement

Every Artificial Intelligence application should run within a virtual environment. No other applications should exist within the virtual environment as to provides another layer of security and prevent the instance from leveraging other applications. Virtualization limits the potential of damage to the operating system, data, hardware, and users operating at the OS level.

In the event an application goes rouge, triggered by malicious code, perhaps a worm, or even of it's own accord. The ability to snapshot and restore snapshots allow rapid recovery of potential AI pitfalls.
