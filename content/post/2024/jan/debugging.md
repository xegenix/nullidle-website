# Initial Plan

My goal was to start an entirely different website, but as I started using some content from NULLidle.com it just made more sense for a change in direction. It is also a relief having a statically served site, while I enjoy the benefits and features most content management systems may offer, this offers a level of security I can be comfortable with.

# End Results 

We are still working on getting shit in order, but we did achieve a feew positives. 

- Eliminated the need for a server.
- Massive performance gains for end-users, content served directly from CDN.
- Un-intended upgrade for the nullidle website.
- Omnipotence achieved. We exist nowhere, yet we are everywhere. Thanks Cloudflare
