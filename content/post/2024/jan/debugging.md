# Initial Plan

My goal was to start an entirely different website, but as I started using some content from NULLidle.com it just made more sense for a change in direction. It is also a relief having a statically served site, while I enjoy the benefits and features most content management systems may offer, this offers a level of security I can be comfortable with.

# The Outcome

While the outcome was not what I initially intended, it did have several benefits for both myself and end-users.

- Our site is now technically serverless.
- Operation costs are down without the need to pay for a server.
- Increased performance for end-users as content is served from their closest CDN provider
- We got an unintended site upgrade for nullidle.com
- We have become omni-potent! We exist no where, yet we are everywhere (Thanks Cloudflare!)
